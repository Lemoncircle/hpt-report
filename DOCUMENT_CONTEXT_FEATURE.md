- [x] Git commit with comprehensive message
- [x] Pushed to GitHub repository
- [x] Automatic Vercel deployment triggered

### üîÑ **Automatic Deployment**
Since your application is connected to Vercel with GitHub integration, the deployment will happen automatically:
1. **Build Process**: Vercel will build the application
2. **Deployment**: New version will be deployed to production
3. **URL**: Same URL as before - no changes needed

## üß™ **Testing the Feature**

### Test Scenarios
1. **Without Context**: Upload Excel file only - should show "AI-Powered Analysis"
2. **With Context**: Upload text documents + Excel file - should show "Organization-Specific Analysis"
3. **File Management**: Add/remove context documents before analysis
4. **History**: Check that context information persists in analysis history

### Sample Context Documents
Create test files with organizational content:
- `company_values.pdf` - Company values and mission
- `performance_policy.docx` - Performance review guidelines
- `employee_handbook.txt` - Employee handbook excerpts
- `org_chart.md` - Organizational structure
